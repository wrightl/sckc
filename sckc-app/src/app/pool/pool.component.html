      <p>
        Pool sessions are held on Tuesday evenings every 2 weeks at Hillborough
        Leisure Centre. Bookings can be made using the link next to the session
        you would like to book on our <a href="events.aspx">Events</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should arrive at 7:30pm in order to be signed in and changed ready
        for the session to start at 8:00pm. Sessions last for either 90 minutes
        for a full session, or 45 minutes if you would prefer to paddle for half
        a session.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pool provides a nice warm environment for first time paddlers, as
        well as somewhere for more advanced paddlers to practice their skills or
        learn to roll.
