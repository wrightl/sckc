  <h3>Pricing</h3>

  <p>
    The club year runs from 1st October to 30th September at which time ALL
    annual memberships are renewed. For new members joining during the year we
    offer pro-rata pricing to reduce the cost of the first year membership,
    taking into account the reduced membership period.
