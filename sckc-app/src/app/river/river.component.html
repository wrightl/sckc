    River paddle sessions take place on Sunday mornings all year round, and
    occasionally on Tuesday evenings through the Summer months. All sessions
    must be booked in advance to ensure that we have appropriate coaching cover.
    Bookings can be made using the link next to the session you would like to
    book on our
    <a routerLink="/events">Booking</a> page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sunday sessions start at 9am and typically run until about 12pm, with
    approximately 2 hours on the water depending on conditions and the group of
    paddlers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Tuesday evening sessions usually begin in May and run through to
    October. They start at 7pm and run through to about 9pm, depending on
    weather, available list and the paddlers. Bookings must be made by the
    preceeding Tuesday to ensure coaches are available.

  <h3>What to Bring</h3>

  <p>
    While we can supply most of the equipment you'll need to get started, you
    will need to bring:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Suitable Clothing - ideally a waterproof top, and light clothing. Heavy
      clothing is not suitable because it can get waterlogged when wet and make
      swimming difficult
    </li>
    <li>
      Suitable footwear - Ideally boating slip-on shoes. Trainers are not
      suitable as they are bulky and can prevent a quick exit from the boat
    </li>
    <li>Warm, dry clothing to change into afterwards</li>
    <li>A towel</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We can supply the rest of the equipment you'll need including a boat (kayak
    or canoe), paddle, buoyancy aid, spraydeck and helmet.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I Bring My Own Equipment?</h3>

  <p>
    Yes you can! Please be aware though that it must be suitable for the
    occasion and will need to be checked by the a club official before use. If
    you're not sure please
    <a href="mailto:enquiries@sheffieldcitykayaclub.co.uk">contact us</a>, or add
    a note to your booking
  </p>

  <h3>Do I Need Experience</h3>

  <p>
    Absolutely not! Our aim is to introduce people to canoe or kayaking and to
    help you improve your skills
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <p>
    If it's your first time or you are unsure about venturing out onto the water
    straight away, then attend one of our
    <a routerLink="/pool">Pool</a> sessions first in a nice warm environment!
  </p>

  <h3>Awards</h3>

    Our coaches are fully trained and qualified so if you would like to work
    towards the Personal Performance Awards we can give you the appropriate
    training and assessments, at a pace best suited to you.
